Pick on language, state, and tooling needs. If you want TypeScript, first-class tools, and built-in workflows, choose **Mastra**; if you want Python with graph-controlled, long-running state and robust recovery, choose **LangGraph**. Mastra gives typed agents, tools, and workflows with MCP-style tool patterns and TS ergonomics. LangGraph gives stateful graphs, checkpoints, and failure routing for production agents. AutoGen/AG2 and LlamaIndex are strong alternates but add extra surface without clear wins for your repo’s TS focus. [LangChain AI+3Mastra+3Mastra+3](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Integration plan for `AcidicSoil/prompts`:

1. **Standardize tool interface**: Define each tool as a pure function with JSON-schema I/O; keep MCP parity so tools run via framework or MCP. In Mastra, register them as `tools` on agents/workflows; in LangGraph, wrap as tool nodes. [Mastra+1](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/using-tools-and-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

2. **Wire orchestration**:
    • Mastra path: create a `BuilderAgent` + `ExecutorAgent`, compose a `Workflow` that reads your existing artifacts and invokes tools; use the dev playground for local runs. [Mastra+1](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    • LangGraph path: model the loop as a graph: `planner → tool-selector → tool-node(s) → reviewer`, enable persistence/checkpointing for resumability. [LangChain AI+1](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3. **Task-master bridge**: Add an adapter that ingests `tasks.json` into your agent’s task queue. In Mastra use a workflow step that parses and fans out tasks; in LangGraph add an input node that expands tasks into edges. (Design mirrors CrewAI task objects if you want that style.) [CrewAI Documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tasks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

4. **Memory/state**: Keep framework memory minimal and route long-term memory through your existing memory server or store; both frameworks let you attach custom memory or external stores. LlamaIndex components can be used just for RAG if needed. [LangChain AI+1](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

5. **Observability and retries**: Use Mastra’s built-ins for runs and long jobs, or LangGraph’s checkpoints and edges with retry logic; log tool I/O for later audits. [Mastra+1](https://mastra.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


Shortlist:
• **Mastra (TS)** → best fit for your repo’s TS toolset, direct tool registration, workflows, local playground. [Mastra+1](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• **LangGraph (Py)** → best for resilient state machines and long-running agents; add as a sidecar service if you must stay TS in the main repo. [LangChain AI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• **AutoGen/AG2 (Py)** → multi-agent chat patterns and human-in-the-loop; heavier for your needs. [Microsoft GitHub+2Microsoft GitHub+2](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• **LlamaIndex (Py/TS bindings)** → use targeted pieces (RAG, agents) if you need data+retrievers, not as your primary orchestrator. [LlamaIndex+1](https://www.llamaindex.ai/framework?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

High-leverage steps this week: migrate two existing `prompts` tools into Mastra as typed tools and a minimal `Workflow` that consumes a sample `tasks.json`; in parallel, spike a LangGraph sidecar that runs the same tools via HTTP/stdio to validate parity. This gives an autonomous feel without a repo rewrite while preserving MCP compatibility.

## You asked

if considering mastra for the framework of choice, what would be the best no-cost solutions for the llm providers etc... and agentic workloads?

Thought for 38s

Use a local-first stack with optional free APIs. For zero cost and full control: run **Ollama** for generation and embeddings (supports models like Llama/Mistral and `/api/generate` + `/api/embeddings`), wire Mastra’s agent/tool steps to call those HTTP endpoints, and keep retrieval state in a free, self-hosted vector DB. Pair with self-hosted observability. This avoids volatile “free trial” limits. [Ollama Documentation+1](https://ollama.readthedocs.io/en/api/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Recommended no-cost setup for Mastra agents and workflows:
• **LLM + Embeddings (local):** Ollama runtime; pick small-to-mid models for speed, and `nomic-embed-text` or `mxbai-embed-large` for vectors. Call via REST from Mastra steps. [Ollama Documentation+1](https://ollama.readthedocs.io/en/api/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• **Vector store (local):** Qdrant (Rust, fast ANN), or Chroma (simple JS/TS + Python), or LanceDB (TS/Py with parquet-like storage). Start with Chroma for simplicity, upgrade to Qdrant/LanceDB if scale or ANN needed. [Qdrant+2Chroma Docs+2](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quickstart/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• **SQL option:** Postgres + **pgvector** if you prefer one DB for everything. [GitHub](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• **Observability (local):** **Langfuse** self-host to log traces, spans, tool I/O; add later a hosted plan if desired. [Langfuse+1](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• **Mastra wiring:** Register tools as steps and compose Workflows that your agents can trigger; Mastra supports agent-calls-workflow patterns out of the box. [Mastra+2Mastra+2](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/using-with-agents-and-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you need a hosted “free” fallback:
• **Groq API** has a documented free tier with rate limits; good for fast Llama/Mixtral inference. Swap Mastra’s provider to Groq when local isn’t available. [Groq+1](https://groq.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• **Gemini API (AI Studio)** offers a limited free tier suitable for experiments; do not rely on it for sustained agent loops. [Google AI for Developers+1](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
• “Free via hubs” like OpenRouter or Together change often; treat as burst capacity, not core. Verify current limits before use. [OpenRouter+1](https://openrouter.ai/docs/faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Minimal Mastra plan:

1. Run Ollama locally; expose `/api/generate` and `/api/embeddings`. [Ollama Documentation](https://ollama.readthedocs.io/en/api/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

2. Pick **Chroma** for quick start; later migrate to **Qdrant** if latency/scale demands. [Chroma Docs+1](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3. Log to **Langfuse** self-host for zero SaaS cost. [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

4. In Mastra, define tools as pure JSON I/O; create a Workflow that does: retrieve → reason → tool → reflect. Agents call the workflow for autonomy. [Mastra+1](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/using-with-agents-and-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


Why this is “best” for no-cost: local inference and storage eliminate API bills and unstable free-tier limits while Mastra’s workflows give agentic behavior. When connectivity is available, switch the provider to Groq/Gemini for spikes without changing tool logic. [Groq+1](https://groq.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Thought for 27s

Short answer: **Codex CLI and Gemini CLI are not “providers.”** In Mastra, providers are model backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini). Codex CLI and Gemini CLI are standalone agent CLIs. Use Gemini **API** as a Mastra provider. Do not route Mastra to “Codex CLI” or “Gemini CLI” as if they were models. [Mastra+2Mastra+2](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

What works now

- **Gemini as a provider:** Configure Mastra to call the Gemini API via the Vercel AI SDK layer; set the Gemini key and select a supported model. Mind current model availability and limits. [Google AI for Developers+3Mastra+3Mastra+3](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **OpenAI/others as providers:** Same flow for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. Mastra routes to any supported LLM. [Mastra+1](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


Where Codex CLI and Gemini CLI fit

- **Codex CLI:** It is an open-source terminal agent, not a model service. Treat it as an external client you can run separately; don’t register it as a Mastra provider. [OpenAI Developers+1](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Gemini CLI:** Also an agent that uses Gemini models and supports MCP; it is not a provider. Run it as its own agent or integrate at the tool/process boundary. [Google Cloud+2npm+2](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


If you still want them in your “system”

- **Loose coupling:** Run Codex CLI or Gemini CLI as separate agents for coding workflows, while Mastra agents handle planning/memory. Exchange artifacts via files, git, or HTTP endpoints. [OpenAI Developers+1](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **MCP-based interop:** Use MCP to expose tools/data to whichever agent is the “orchestrator.” Mastra handles typed tools; external MCP clients (e.g., Gemini CLI) can call the same servers. Keep the contract JSON-schema based. [Mastra+2Model Context Protocol+2](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/using-tools-and-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


Minimal steps to get agentic with Mastra

1. Pick a **provider** (e.g., Gemini API or OpenAI) in Mastra and set env keys. [Mastra+1](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

2. Register your tools and compose a **Workflow**; let the agent invoke it for plan-act-reflect. [Mastra+2Mastra+2](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3. Optionally run **Codex CLI or Gemini CLI** alongside for code edits; pass tasks/files between them and Mastra via agreed I/O. [OpenAI Developers+1](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


Net: Use Gemini **API** or another LLM as the Mastra provider. Treat Codex CLI and Gemini CLI as peer agents or operator tools, not providers.

You’re choosing a framework and wiring it into `AcidicSoil/prompts` for autonomous workflows.

- Framework call: Prefer **Mastra** (TypeScript, typed tools/workflows). Use **LangGraph** (Python) if you need graph state, checkpoints, and recovery.

- Integration pattern: Normalize `prompts` tools to pure JSON-schema I/O. Register them as Mastra tools and compose a Workflow (plan → retrieve → act → reflect). Add a bridge to ingest `claude-task-master`’s `tasks.json` into the workflow queue. Keep long-term memory external; log tool I/O for audits.

- No-cost stack for agentic runs: **Ollama** for LLM + embeddings; **Chroma/Qdrant/LanceDB** or **Postgres+pgvector** for vectors; **Langfuse** self-host for traces. Optional hosted free fallback: **Groq** or **Gemini API** for bursts.

- Provider clarification: **Codex CLI** and **Gemini CLI** are not LLM providers. Use **Gemini API/OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama** as providers in Mastra. Treat Codex/Gemini CLI as peer agents or MCP clients and exchange artifacts via files/HTTP, not as model backends.

- Next steps: Move two existing `prompts` tools into Mastra, create a minimal Workflow that consumes a sample `tasks.json`, and prove parity with an external sidecar if you later test LangGraph.

## You asked

how does `https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master` utilize gemini-cli as a provider in their repo with the "ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli" and would that change things for utilizing gemini-cli as a potential provider option for my earlier questions?

---

## ChatGPT Replied

Thought for 36s

Yes. Task Master wires **Gemini CLI as a Vercel AI SDK provider** via the community package **`ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli`**, which bridges the CLI’s `@google/gemini-cli-core` endpoints into the AI SDK “provider/model” abstraction; they then select `provider: gemini-cli` in their model roles and call AI SDK functions as usual. Release notes and issues show active support and break/fix history for this provider inside Task Master. [GitHub+2GitHub+2](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/releases?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

What that means for you: because **Mastra sits on the Vercel AI SDK**, you can also use `ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli` as a drop-in Mastra provider, same as OpenAI/Anthropic. Install the provider, point it at a valid Gemini CLI auth path (GCA license OAuth or API key), and pass `gemini-cli('gemini-2.5-pro' | 'gemini-2.5-flash')` as the agent’s model. Mind version compatibility (AI SDK v4 vs v5) and recent auth changes that sometimes require a Google API key even if you logged in via CLI.

## You asked

can the same be done with codex ?

---

## ChatGPT Replied

Thought for 34s

No. There is **no AI SDK provider for Codex CLI** today, so you cannot select “codex” as a Mastra/Vercel AI SDK model the way Task Master does with `ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli`. Use OpenAI’s normal provider (`@ai-sdk/openai`) for models, and treat **Codex CLI as a peer agent**, not a provider. Codex supports **MCP** and can interoperate at the tool layer or via file/HTTP artifact handoff. [AI SDK+2AI SDK+2](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Workable patterns now:

- **Mastra provider:** OpenAI/Gemini/etc. via official AI SDK providers. [AI SDK+1](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Codex interop:** Connect Codex CLI to your MCP servers or bridges, and exchange tasks/artifacts with your Mastra workflow. [OpenAI+1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


What would change this: if OpenAI ships **Codex API or an AI SDK community provider**, then a drop-in provider becomes feasible. Current Codex releases emphasize CLI/IDE/cloud and MCP access, not an AI SDK provider. [OpenAI+1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

how would the codex MCP work into all of this since codex only supports MCP over stdio?

## ChatGPT Replied

Thought for 16s

Plug Codex in at the **MCP layer** and keep Mastra at the **LLM/agent layer**. Codex is an MCP **host** that speaks **STDIO only**, so you share tools by running the same MCP servers and letting both sides connect: Codex via STDIO, Mastra via the AI SDK’s MCP client. [Model Context Protocol+2docs.snyk.io+2](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

How to wire it:

1. **Run shared MCP servers.** Use any STDIO server you need (docs, memory, custom). Manage and test with MCP Inspector. [GitHub+1](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

2. **Point Codex to them** in `.codex/config.toml` under `[mcp_servers.*]` (Codex speaks STDIO). [docs.snyk.io](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/developer-guardrails-for-agentic-workflows/quickstart-guides-for-mcp/codex-cli-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3. **Let Mastra reach the same servers** using the Vercel AI SDK’s MCP tools client from Node (spawns the same STDIO servers under the hood). Mastra already sits on the AI SDK. [AI SDK+2Mastra+2](https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/mcp-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


If you can’t spawn STDIO from your Mastra process:

- **Add an MCP proxy** that exposes an HTTP/SSE endpoint and bridges to a local STDIO server. Mastra connects to the proxy; Codex continues to use STDIO directly. [GitHub](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


If you prefer Codex to call **your** Mastra tools:

- **Invert control:** wrap selected Mastra tools as an **MCP server** (Node TS server template) so Codex can call them over STDIO. Keep tool I/O JSON-schema to preserve parity. [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


Notes and limits:

- Codex is **STDIO-only** for MCP, so do not expect it to consume HTTP-only MCP servers without a proxy. Community reports confirm the STDIO constraint. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1mn6s4h/codex_is_not_fully_mcp_compliant_how_to_work/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Mastra remains your agentic orchestrator and LLM provider hub (OpenAI/Gemini/Ollama/Groq). MCP is only for tools/data exchange. [Mastra+2Vercel+2](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


Net: run one set of MCP servers; Codex connects via STDIO, Mastra connects via the AI SDK MCP client or via an STDIO↔HTTP proxy. This yields shared tools and artifacts across both systems without treating Codex as a “provider.” [AI SDK+1](https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/mcp-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
