## You asked

I am trying to find a way to utilize the `https://github.com/AcidicSoil/prompts` repo so that it can utilize the output of tools like the `https://github.com/AcidicSoil/claude-task-master` tool. `https://github.com/AcidicSoil/prompts` would need to work independently of task-master but utilize the output artifacts of it to its benefit, for its strengths are managing the state of workflows and advancing or blocking depending on the state of the project's progress. Task-master uses a tasks.json to manage tasks, which is native to the task-master. The point of the prompts repo is a workflow state management system that works independently but can also utilize a structured form like the outputs of task-master to its advantage for a more enhanced workflow. Find a way to improve the prompts repo to get to this point so it can do just that. After we get the final quirks worked out in the prompts repo, a CLI tool will also be needed also so users can interact with it via the shell, giving the prompts repo multiple ways a user can utilize it in their workflows. Additional queries to answer: 1. what's the way best to pick and integrate an agentic framework into `https://github.com/AcidicSoil/prompts` to improve and power the workflow for a more autonomous feeling when using it? 2. if considering mastra for the framework of choice, what would be the best no-cost solutions for the llm providers etc... and agentic workloads? 3. are codex and gemini-cli considered as provider options ? or is there specic steps needed first to get those to work as an agentic system? - how does `https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master` utilize gemini-cli as a provider in their repo with the "ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli" and would that change things for utilizing gemini-cli as a potential provider option for my earlier questions? 4. can the same be done with codex? (if not possible yet, then how with MCP?) - how would the codex MCP work into all of this since codex only supports MCP over stdio

Thought for 2m 2s

Here’s the shortest path.

1) Make `prompts` ingest Task-Master and run its own state engine
=================================================================

- **Define a canonical task schema** in `prompts` that is a superset of Task-Master’s `tasks.json` fields (`id,title,description,status,dependencies,priority,details,testStrategy,subtasks`). Task-Master’s schema is documented here; mirror it 1:1 so ingest is trivial. [docs.task-master.dev](https://docs.task-master.dev/capabilities/task-structure)

- **Add an adapter**: `src/adapters/taskmaster/ingest.ts` that validates and maps `tasks.json` → `PromptsTask[]`.

- **State engine**: `src/state/graph.ts` computes readiness by dependency closure and priority; `src/state/update.ts` mutates `pending|in_progress|blocked|done`. Provide `next()` and `advance()` primitives.

- **Artifacts I/O**: `src/artifacts/` for reading Task-Master outputs (e.g., complexity reports) to enrich metadata, but keep them optional. [docs.task-master.dev](https://docs.task-master.dev/capabilities/task-structure)

- **MCP server**: expose tools over **STDIO** so Codex and others can call them:

  - `tasks.ingest({ source:"taskmaster", path|string|json }) → {count}`

  - `tasks.next() → {task}`

  - `tasks.update({id,status}) → {ok}`

  - `workflow.block/advance(...)`

- **Files to add (minimal)**

  - `src/adapters/taskmaster/ingest.ts`

  - `src/state/{graph.ts,update.ts,types.ts}`

  - `src/mcp/server.ts` (stdio)

  - `schemas/task.json` (JSON Schema, superset of Task-Master)


2) Ship a CLI for shell use (besides MCP)
=========================================

- **Binary**: `bin/prompts` using `commander` or `oclif`.

- **Core commands**:

  - `prompts ingest --taskmaster ./tasks.json`

  - `prompts next`

  - `prompts update --id 12 --status in_progress`

  - `prompts graph --format dot`

- Keep the CLI thin; all logic lives in the shared `src/` used by MCP too.


3) Wire Mastra as the agentic layer (lightweight, pluggable)
============================================================

- Mastra is a TS agent framework and works with **Vercel AI SDK providers** and community providers (Ollama, Gemini CLI, etc.). [Mastra+2Mastra+2](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Create `packages/prompts-tools` that exports small tool factories (`getNextTaskTool`, `updateTaskTool`, etc.). Register them inside a Mastra agent; the agent calls into your state engine, not Task-Master.

- Keep Mastra unaware of Task-Master. Your adapter feeds the state engine; Mastra just consumes your tools.


4) Zero-cost model options for Mastra
=====================================

- **Local first**: **Ollama** via an AI-SDK community provider (several maintained variants). Works without API keys and runs local models like Llama 3.x. [npm+2npm+2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ollama-ai-provider?activeTab=readme&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Gemini CLI** provider: **`ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli`** lets AI-SDK/Mastra call Gemini through the official CLI or API key; supports OAuth personal creds. Useful if you have the free **GCA** allowance. [AI SDK+1](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/community-providers/gemini-cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Free usage context: Google’s **Gemini CLI** preview ships with generous request limits under GCA; suitable for dev workloads. [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/692517/google-gemini-cli-ai-agent-dev-terminal?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


5) Are Codex and Gemini-CLI “providers”? What to do
===================================================

- **Gemini-CLI**: Yes, via **`ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli`** in the Vercel AI SDK ecosystem. Use it from Mastra as a model provider. [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/community-providers/gemini-cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Codex**: Not a Vercel-AI “provider.” Treat **Codex as a client** that consumes your MCP server. Codex **supports MCP via STDIO only** as of now. So export your tools over STDIO and add them to Codex’s TOML. [GitHub+2GitHub+2](https://github.com/openai/codex)


6) Exact touch points you need to add
=====================================

A) Mastra model providers (no-cost defaults)
--------------------------------------------

- **Ollama path** (local): use a community Ollama provider with AI SDK v5+; point at `http://localhost:11434`. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-sdk-ollama?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Gemini-CLI path**:

  - Install `ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli`.

  - Auth: `authType: 'oauth-personal'` uses `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`. [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/community-providers/gemini-cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


B) Codex ↔ `prompts` MCP hookup
-------------------------------

- In `~/.codex/config.toml`, add your server under `mcp_servers` (Codex reads this file and launches servers as subprocesses):

        [mcp_servers.prompts]
        command = "node"
        args = ["/c/Users/user/path/to/prompts/dist/mcp/server.js"]


    Codex documents MCP enablement and the TOML path; transport is **STDIO** today. [GitHub+2GitHub+2](https://github.com/openai/codex)


C) Gemini-CLI ↔ `prompts` MCP hookup (optional direct use)
----------------------------------------------------------

- In Gemini-CLI `settings.json`, you can register MCP servers:

        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "prompts": { "command": "node", "args": ["/c/Users/user/path/to/prompts/dist/mcp/server.js"] }
          }
        }


    Gemini-CLI documents `mcpServers` config and supports OAuth or API key auth. [google-gemini.github.io+1](https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/docs/tools/mcp-server.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


7) Minimal migration plan for `prompts`
=======================================

1. **Add superset schema + adapter** for `tasks.json`. Target read-only ingest first. [docs.task-master.dev](https://docs.task-master.dev/capabilities/task-structure)

2. **Implement `next()` and `update()`** in a pure module.

3. **Expose MCP tools (STDIO)** that wrap those two functions.

4. **Wrap a CLI** that calls the same functions.

5. **Create Mastra sample** that registers `prompts-tools` and uses **Ollama** by default; provide a second sample that swaps to **Gemini-CLI** provider. [Mastra+1](https://mastra.ai/docs/getting-started/model-providers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


8) Answers to your explicit questions
=====================================

1. **Best way to pick + integrate an agentic framework**: Use **Mastra** for orchestration and keep `prompts` as the **tool/state system** exposed via MCP and a CLI. This keeps provider choice fluid and lets Codex/Gemini-CLI interop through the same surface. [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/docs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

2. **No-cost LLM + workloads**: Default to **Ollama** locally for chat and tools; add **Gemini-CLI** as a second “free” lane if you have GCA. Both plug into the AI-SDK layer Mastra uses. [npm+1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-sdk-ollama?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3. **Codex and Gemini-CLI as providers**: Gemini-CLI yes (AI-SDK community provider). Codex no; integrate via MCP STDIO. [AI SDK+1](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/community-providers/gemini-cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

    - **How Task-Master uses Gemini-CLI**: The project integrates Gemini-CLI capabilities and toggles them via config; the community provider shows exact AI-SDK usage and OAuth details. Expect auth quirk issues reported by users. [GitHub+3GitHub+3AI SDK+3](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/releases?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

4. **“Same with Codex?”**: Not as an AI-SDK provider. Use your **MCP server over STDIO** and let Codex consume it via TOML. If you ever need remote/SSE servers, you’d need a proxy since Codex is STDIO-only today. [GitHub+1](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2129?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


That’s the plan with the fewest moving parts and the highest reuse.
