feat(cli): complete and verify distribution workflow

This commit finalizes the end-to-end workflow for packaging and distributing the CLI tool. The entire process, from local build verification to a simulated npm publish, has been executed and documented within the Taskmaster system.

Key validation steps completed:
- Ran local builds and smoke-tested CLI commands directly.
- Validated the `npm link` workflow for local development testing.
- Used `npm pack` to inspect the package contents and ensure no source files are included.
- Performed a `npm publish --dry-run` to confirm readiness for publishing.

This work is captured in new and updated tasks within Taskmaster, providing a detailed record of the validation process. A build error related to `tsconfig.build.json` was also resolved.
