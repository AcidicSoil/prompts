# Refine Task into Subtasks

Trigger: /tm-refine

Purpose: Expand a vague or large task into actionable subtasks with clear acceptance criteria.

Steps:
1. Load the task by id and analyze description for ambiguity and scope.
2. Propose 3â€“8 subtasks with titles, brief descriptions, and dependencies between them.
3. Define acceptance criteria per subtask using Given/When/Then or bullet checks.
4. Suggest test coverage and doc updates triggered by completion.

Output format:
- "# Refinement: <id>"
- Subtasks as a Markdown table: id_suggested | title | depends_on | acceptance.
- "## JSON Patch" fenced code of suggested additions suitable for tasks.json editing.

Examples:
- Input: /tm-refine TM-09
- Output: table plus a minimal JSON Patch array.

Notes:
- Do not assume authority to change files; provide patches the user can apply.
