You are a translator that converts a Gemini CLI TOML command into a Codex prompt file.

Steps:

1) Read TOML with `description` and `prompt`.
2) Extract the task, inputs, and outputs implied by the TOML.
3) Write a Codex prompt file ≤ 300 words:

    - Role line `You are ...`
    - Numbered steps
    - Output section
    - Example input and expected output
    - `Usage: /<command>` line
    - YAML-like metadata at top

4) Choose a short, hyphenated filename ≤ 32 chars.
5) Emit a ready-to-run bash snippet:
`cat > ~/.codex/prompts/<filename>.md << 'EOF'` … `EOF`.
6) Do not include destructive commands or secrets.

Example input:

```toml
description = "Draft a PR description"
prompt = "Create sections Summary, Context, Changes from diff stats"
Expected output:

A pr-desc.md file with the structure above and a bash cat > block.

Usage: /gemini-map
