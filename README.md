# Codex Prompts — Vibe Coding Additions

This pack extends the default Codex CLI prompts with vibe-coding playbooks inspired by YC cadences. Drop the folder into `~/.codex/prompts` and you get a catalog of opinionated helpers covering planning, scope control, testing, audits, and model orchestration.

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this repository into `~/.codex/prompts`. The CLI hot-reloads changes, but restarting Codex guarantees the new commands are registered.
2. Optionally commit the directory into your dotfiles so the prompts travel with your workstation setup.

## Contributor workflow

Run these commands whenever you add or edit prompts so the generated catalog stays in sync:

1. `npm install` — install the TypeScript tooling used by the validation scripts.
2. `npm run validate:metadata` — confirm every prompt’s front matter matches the lifecycle workflow.
3. `npm run build:catalog` — regenerate `catalog.json` and refresh the README tables.

`npm run build:catalog` must run after each prompt change; it keeps our published metadata accurate for the upcoming [MCP roadmap](#future-enhancements) work on tool exposure and state tracking. The pre-commit hook and CI guard execute these checks and will fail when `catalog.json` or the README tables are stale, so expect local or remote failures if the command is skipped.

### Prompts CLI

Use the bundled CLI to drive Task-Master ingestion and readiness logic without an MCP client:

- `npm run prompts -- ingest [--tasks <path>] [--tag <tag>]` — validate `tasks.json` against the canonical schema and emit the normalized task list with a remap report.

  ```bash
  npm run prompts -- ingest --tasks .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json --tag master --pretty
  ```

- `npm run prompts -- next` — print the highest-priority ready task alongside the full ready queue.
- `npm run prompts -- advance <id> <status> [--write]` — update a task’s canonical status. Without `--write` the command runs in dry-run mode and leaves the source file untouched.

  ```bash
  npm run prompts -- advance 42 done --write --tasks ./project/tasks.json
  ```

- `npm run prompts -- graph [--format dot|json]` — export the dependency graph as JSON (default) or Graphviz DOT text.
- `npm run prompts -- status` — summarise totals per status, the current `next` pick, and the ready list. Pass `--pretty` to pretty-print JSON.

CLI options:

- `--tasks <path>` defaults to `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` relative to the current working directory.
- `--tag <tag>` selects a named Task Master tag; defaults to `master`.
- `--write` toggles persistence for `advance`. When omitted the command runs in read-only mode and returns the updated payload without saving.
- `--pretty` enables multi-line, indented JSON output.

The CLI shares the same logic as the MCP tools, so any changes remain consistent across all surfaces.

👉 For a full command reference (including options and example output), see [`docs/mcp-cli.md`](docs/mcp-cli.md).

Once the npm package is published you can install the CLI globally with `npm install -g prompts` (or invoke it ad‑hoc via `npx prompts`). Until then, run it locally with the script above after `npm run build`, or execute `node bin/prompts <command>` directly. The shim loads `dist/cli/main.js`, so remember to rebuild after TypeScript edits.

### Server capabilities overview

The MCP server bundled in this repository now ships with the following surfaced features:

- **Prompt resources** – every prompt markdown file is exposed as a capped `file://` MCP resource, enabling Inspector or other clients to browse the catalog without direct filesystem access.
- **Dynamic prompt tools** – `registerPromptTools` converts each prompt definition into a callable MCP tool with Zod‑derived schemas and structured JSON output alongside trimmed previews.
- **Workflow automation** – `workflow/refresh_metadata`, `workflow/export_task_list`, and `workflow/advance_state` provide scripted catalog regeneration, backlog export, and persistent status logging.
- **State persistence** – completions recorded through `advance_state` (or the CLI equivalent) are saved atomically to `.mcp/state.json` via the `StateStore`, ensuring MCP clients and local scripts share the same progress view.
- **Script parity** – the CLI wraps the MCP tools so automation can run from shell environments, CI, or MCP clients with identical behavior.

#### Running the stdio server

1. Build the project (`npm run build`) so the compiled server exists under `dist/mcp/server.js`.
2. Launch the server with stdio transport:

   ```bash
   node dist/mcp/server.js --tasks .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json --tag master --write=false
   ```

   - `--tasks` and `--tag` mirror the CLI flags and default to `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` and `master` respectively.
   - `--write` defaults to `false`; set to `true` only when you want `set_task_status` calls to persist changes back to `tasks.json`.
3. Register the process with your MCP client (Codex, Gemini, Cursor, etc.) as a Command/stdio server.

Available task tools:

- `next_task` — returns the highest-priority ready task plus the full ready queue.
- `list_tasks` — emits the normalized task list exactly as the ingest adapter provides it.
- `get_task` — fetches a single task (including subtasks) by numeric ID.
- `graph_export` — returns dependency graph nodes suitable for DOT conversion.
- `set_task_status` — updates a task when the server runs with `--write=true`.

Workflow tools (`refresh_metadata`, `export_task_list`, `advance_state`) remain available for prompt maintenance and state capture. Each tool uses the same shared utilities as the CLI, keeping behaviour consistent across surfaces.

👉 Detailed setup instructions and MCP client snippets live in [`docs/mcp-cli.md`](docs/mcp-cli.md).

## CLI Distribution and Usage Lifecycle

The CLI ships alongside the MCP server, so publishing it cleanly keeps both entry points in sync. Use the checklist below whenever you cut a release or help teammates install the tool locally.

### Prepare the package

1. Confirm the `bin` field in `package.json` still maps the public command (`prompts`) to the shim at `bin/prompts`.
2. Ensure the CLI source (`src/cli/main.ts`) retains its shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) before compiling.
3. Keep the `files` array limited to distributable assets (`bin/`, `dist/`, `resources/`, `prompts/`, docs) so source tests stay out of the tarball.
4. Run `npm run validate:metadata` and `npm run build` to refresh generated artifacts.
5. The `prepublishOnly` script now executes `npm run test && npm run build`; leave it intact so `npm publish` fails fast when tests or builds break.

### Local development workflow

1. Compile the CLI: `npm run build` (rerun after any TypeScript change).
2. Exercise the command directly without linking: `node bin/prompts next`.
3. Link globally for shell usage:

   ```bash
   npm link
   prompts next
   ```

4. When finished, remove the symlink: `npm unlink` (in the project) and `npm unlink -g prompts` (globally) to avoid stale binaries.

### Publishing to npm

1. Authenticate (`npm login`) and bump the version: `npm version <major|minor|patch>`.
2. Build and inspect the package before shipping:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run build
   npm_config_cache=$(pwd)/tmp/npm-cache npm pack --dry-run
   ```

   Verify only the expected files appear in the dry-run output.
3. Publish with provenance: `npm publish --provenance --access public` (have OTP ready for 2FA accounts).
4. Post-publish, double-check `npm view prompts version` and skim the npm README for formatting regressions.
5. Tag corrections or rollbacks: adjust dist-tags (`npm dist-tag add prompts@<version> latest`) or, within the 24-hour window, `npm unpublish prompts@<version>` if absolutely necessary.

### End-user installation and maintenance

- Install globally: `npm install -g prompts` (or run once with `npx prompts list`).
- Update to the latest release: `npm update -g prompts`.
- Remove the CLI when no longer needed: `npm uninstall -g prompts`.
- If troubleshooting, check the published README on npm or run `npm view prompts readme` to confirm the expected commands and flags.

Share these steps with downstream users when announcing a new release so they can upgrade confidently.

### Running the MCP server with Inspector

When testing the MCP server via stdio transports, launch the CLI entrypoint so stdout remains reserved for JSON-RPC traffic.

1. Build the server once: `npm run build` (produces `dist/mcp/server.js`).
2. In MCP Inspector set:
   - **Transport Type:** `STDIO`
   - **Command:** `node`
   - **Arguments:** `dist/mcp/server.js`
   - **Working Directory:** project root

All logging is emitted to stderr, so Inspector receives a clean protocol stream without any npm banners.

### Daily MCP User Flow

The MCP server is meant to sit alongside your editor or chat client all day. It exposes the same task logic as the CLI so humans and agents share a single source of truth.

1) Discover next work item (prioritized and dependency-aware)

```bash
node dist/mcp/server.js --tasks .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json --tag master --write=false
# From your MCP client, call: next_task → { task, ready }
```

2) Do the work, then record completion (safe by default)

- Read-only by default (`--write=false`).
- Enable persistence only when ready:

```bash
node dist/mcp/server.js --tasks .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json --tag master --write=true
# From MCP: set_task_status { id, status: "done" } → { task, persisted: true }
# Or: workflow/advance_state to log richer completion context
```

3) Execute mapped actions (optional, gated)

- Map a task id to a local script via task `metadata.action` or `actions.json`.
- Preview first:

```bash
# From MCP: workflow_run_task_action { taskId, dryRun: true } → shows `npm run` command
```

- Enable exec when ready (allowlisted scripts only):

```bash
node dist/mcp/server.js --tasks .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json --tag master --write=true --exec-enabled
# From MCP: workflow_run_task_action { taskId, dryRun: false } → { ok, exitCode, output }
```

4) Re-plan quickly with visibility

- Inspect dependencies and risk:

```bash
# From MCP: graph_export → { nodes }
# From MCP: workflow/export_task_list → curated list for dashboards/agents
```

Why this helps daily:

- Deterministic “what’s next” signal that respects dependencies.
- Fast feedback loop: status updates immediately inform the next suggestion.
- Shared truth for people and tools (CLI, MCP clients, automations) so plans don’t drift.
- Safety-first defaults (read-only), with explicit gates for persistence and execution.

### MCP tools

The server exposes task tools, workflow helpers, and execution tools.

Workflow helpers:

- `refresh_metadata`: runs the same scripts we call manually:

- `npm run validate:metadata`
- `npm run build:catalog` (pass `updateWorkflow: true` to also run with `--update-workflow`)

Invoke this tool from Inspector or any MCP client to regenerate `catalog.json`, README tables, and—optionally—`WORKFLOW.md` in one step.

- `export_task_list`: reads `resources/prompts.meta.yaml` and returns a normalized task list (`[{ id, title, dependsOn, status: 'pending' }]`) to feed external dashboards or automations.
- `advance_state`: writes task/tool completion snapshots (with optional artifacts) to `.mcp/state.json`, providing durable history for MCP clients and the CLI.

Execution tools (gated; see docs/mcp-cli.md for details):

- `workflow_run_task_action`: resolve `{script,args}` from task `metadata.action` or `actions.json` and dispatch through the safe executor.
- `workflow_run_script`: run an allowlisted npm script with optional args; supports `dryRun`; live runs require `--exec-enabled`.
- `workflow_run_tests`: wrapper that calls `test:jest` via `run_script`.
- `workflow_run_build`: wrapper that calls `build` via `run_script`.
- `workflow_run_lint`: wrapper that calls `lint` via `run_script`.

Notes:

- Scripts must be allowlisted in `package.json#mcpAllowScripts`.
- Live execution is disabled by default; enable by launching the server with `--exec-enabled` (or setting `PROMPTS_EXEC_ALLOW=1`).
- Map task ids to actions via task `metadata.action` or `actions.json` (keyed by task id). See docs/mcp-cli.md for schema and examples.

## Using these prompts

- **Direct slash commands**: Invoke the files that declare a `Trigger:` (table below) straight from Codex. Example: `/planning-process Add OAuth login` opens `planning-process.md` and walks through the feature plan template.
- **Gemini mapper prompt**: `/gemini-map` is a single translator prompt (`gemini-map.md`) that converts Gemini CLI TOML commands into Codex prompt files. Use it only when migrating Gemini content; all other prompts run directly with their own slash commands.

## Prompt metadata

Every lifecycle prompt starts with YAML front matter so docs and tooling stay in sync:

```yaml
---
phase: "P5 Quality Gates & Tests"
gate: "Test Gate"
status: "Runner green locally and wired into CI before expanding coverage."
previous:
  - "/auth-scaffold"
  - "/ui-screenshots"
next:
  - "/integration-test"
  - "/coverage-guide"
---
```

- `phase` — primary stage(s) from [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md). Use a string for a single phase or a YAML list for cross-phase helpers.
- `gate` — named gate or checkpoint the prompt supports.
- `status` — the success criteria required to pass that gate.
- `previous` — prerequisite prompts or setup tasks.
- `next` — recommended follow-up prompts once the gate clears.

Maintainers and the metadata validator rely on this block to keep the stage catalog coherent.

## Future enhancements

The current release already exposes the prompt catalog as MCP resources/tools, bundles workflow automation, and delivers a publishable CLI. Next milestones focus on rounding out automation and platform ergonomics:

- **Task Master parity** — Point `workflow/export_task_list` at `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` so MCP clients mirror the Task Master backlog (Task 20).
- **Rate limiting utilities** — Ship the token-bucket helper (Task 9) for future outbound integrations.
- **Expanded lifecycle prompts** — Author remaining planning/scaffolding/testing/release prompts (Tasks 13–17) and validate them end-to-end (Task 18).
- **MCP notifications & sync** — Emit DocFetch and completion events, and optionally push Task Master status updates through MCP once bidirectional APIs are available.
- **CLI niceties** — After the npm package is live, add command completions, structured logging flags, and richer `export` formats to support external automations.
