# Regression Guard

Trigger: /regression-guard

Purpose: Detect unrelated changes and add tests to prevent regressions.

## Steps

1. Run `git diff --name-status origin/main...HEAD` and highlight unrelated files.
2. Propose test cases that lock current behavior for touched modules.
3. Suggest CI checks to block large unrelated diffs.

## Output format

- Report with file groups, risk notes, and test additions.

## Notes

- Keep proposed tests minimal and focused.

## Stage alignment

- **Phase**: [P5 Quality Gates & Tests](WORKFLOW.md#p5-quality-gates--tests)
- **Gate**: Test Gate â€” regression coverage in place before CI hand-off.
- **Previous prompts**: `/coverage-guide`
- **Next prompts**: `/version-control-guide`, `/devops-automation`
