# Modular Architecture

Trigger: /modular-architecture

Purpose: Enforce modular boundaries and clear external interfaces.

2. Flag cross-module imports and circular deps.
3. Propose boundaries, facades, and internal folders.
4. Add "contract tests" for public APIs.

## Output format

- Diagram-ready list of modules and edges, plus diffs.
