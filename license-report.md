2. Create a license inventory with notices of copyleft/unknown licenses.
3. Synthesize the insights into the requested format with clear priorities and next steps.

- Begin with a concise summary that restates the goal: Summarize third‑party licenses and risk flags.
- Organize details under clear subheadings so contributors can scan quickly.
- Flag copyleft or unknown licenses and suggest remediation timelines.
